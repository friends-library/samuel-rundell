[short="Chapter II -- The Worship Ordained of God"]
== Chapter II: The Worship Ordained of God Under the Christian Dispensation

In the conversation which our Lord condescended to hold with the woman of Samaria,
he declared:

[quote.scripture, , John 4:23-24]
____
The hour is coming, and now is,
when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth;
for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.
God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.
____

[.no-indent]
On other occasions He said, "`No one comes to the Father except through Me,`" (John 14:6)
and "`without Me you can do nothing.`" (John 15:5)
These declarations plainly indicate that the worship of God
under the Christian dispensation is of a spiritual character;
and must be offered in truth;--that we cannot come unto the Father
(and offer unto Him this true worship) but by Jesus Christ,
who is "`__the way, the truth, and the life.__`"
Therefore His assistance is communicated to us by the quickening influence of His Holy Spirit,
without which the important duty of worship cannot be acceptably performed.
This appears to have been the sentiment of the apostle Paul; for he declares that
"`No one can say (or acknowledge) that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.`"
Hence it is apparent that all worship having a different origin
is not the true worship of God, but is rather that which the apostle
designates as "`will-worship.`"^
footnote:[Editor`'s note: Here Rundell is quoting the KJV translation of Colossians 2:23
which, although a very accurate rendering of the underlying Greek word, is an unfamiliar
phrase to most modern Christians.
More contemporary versions usually translate the same word (also accurately)
as "`self-imposed worship`" or "`self-made religion.`"] (Col. 2:23)
It is so termed because it is merely the act of self--the mere product of the will and
wisdom of man--whether or not it be adorned with eloquence of speech,
or accompanied with vocal or instrumental music.
Even if this worship is supported by human authority, and sanctioned by it as orthodox,
still the declaration of Jesus Christ is applicable unto it.
"`In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.`" (Matt. 15:9)

It may be said of merely nominal Christians in the present day,
that although in many instances
thoughtlessness respecting religion is the prominent feature of their character;
yet, in many other cases,
they are zealous in supporting the creeds of the religious
communities to which they are individually attached.
But, notwithstanding their zeal, these refuse to submit to the convictions of the
Spirit of Christ--they will not come to His baptism--they refuse to walk in the path of
self-denial;--and the consequence is that their hearts are not
cleansed--the chaff is not burnt up--they remain carnally-minded.
Now while they continue in this state of resistance against the Spirit of Christ,
there is cause for them to fear that the worship which they offer to Almighty God
is not more acceptable in His sight than was that of the Pharisees formerly.
The Pharisees rejected Christ in His outward, or personal appearance;
the merely nominal Christians above described reject Christ in His inward,
or spiritual appearance in their hearts.
Like the Pharisees, they think they "`have eternal life`" in the Scriptures;
and like them also, they will not come to Christ, that they "`might have life.`"
(See John 5:39-40)

But it is much to be lamented that the adversary of mankind so much prevails,
not only in diverting the merely nominal Christian from
even entering on the true spiritual course,
but also in impeding the progress of many serious persons who have begun to
walk in it--even those who, loving the Lord Jesus in a good degree of sincerity,
have so far followed His holy guidance
as to be redeemed from many evil customs and vanities of the world.
Yet these, not patiently and humbly submitting to the operation of that power
by which "`old things are`" made to "`pass away`" and
"`all things to become new, and all things`" to be "`of God,`" (2 Cor. 5:17-18)
find their growth in the divine life obstructed.
Their strong attachment to human prescriptions
(relative to forms of worship and ceremonial observances)
prevents them from attaining that clearness of spiritual discernment
into which they would have been introduced, if, in childlike simplicity,
they had been passive in the Lord`'s hand, like clay in the hand of the potter.
In this state of defective submission to the divine will
they are not in a capacity duly to appreciate the benefits
resulting from a practical faith _in the name_ of the Son of God.
Their views and dependence (being outwardly directed)
are limited to a merely literal explanation of this holy name;
they do not therefore clearly perceive the necessity of
seeking and waiting for divine influence
to effect the needful preparation of heart before Him,
previous to the offering of their prayers at the throne of grace.
And if in their assemblies for divine worship they are
not gathered together in the name of Christ,
can it be expected that He will be in the midst of them? (See Matt. 18:20)

The necessity of the influence of the Spirit of Christ
in this solemn engagement of worship is fully acknowledged by the apostle Paul.
For, notwithstanding his extraordinary gifts
and large experience in the ministry of the Gospel, he declares
respecting himself and his fellow-believers,
"`Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses;
for we know not what we should pray for as we ought,
but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us
with groanings which cannot be uttered;`" (Rom. 8:26) that is, as a late writer^
footnote:[Priscilla H. Gurney]
observes, "`with fervent internal aspirations,
the sensible effect of that powerful cause,--
even the silent operation of the Spirit of truth;
showing unto man from time to time his real condition; and teaching him directly
both what to pray for, and how to pray aright.`"

By Him, Jesus Christ, let us then worship and serve God
"`in the newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter;`" (Rom. 7:6)
believing _in His name_,--even in that name
which God has exalted above every name, "`that at`" or in^
footnote:[J. G. Bevan`'s [.book-title]#Life of Paul,# note, page 363.]
"`the name of Jesus, every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth,
and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.`" (Phil. 2:10-11)
If the true _bowing at the name of Jesus_ were understood
and witnessed in our hearts,--were we so humbled by His power
as to submit to His government, however contrary to our former views and
practices--the performance of our religious as well as of our moral duties,
being thereby brought under His holy influence and control,
then we would be Christians indeed.
We would be able in truth to address Jesus Christ as
our Lord;--His holy light being our Leader,
and His holy will (made known to us thereby) being done in and by us in all things.
Thus would the name of Jesus be "`exalted above every`" other
"`name, to the glory of God the Father.`"

In the opening of this chapter reference was made to those merely nominal Christians
who, rejecting the admonitions of the light of Christ,
refuse to enter the path of self-denial and are consequently disqualified
(while they persist in their disobedience)
for the performance of that worship which is in spirit and in truth.
In pursuing this subject it is my design to show the necessity
not only of entering "`in at the narrow gate,`" but also of
_continuing_ "`to walk in the narrow path,`" bearing the cross daily
and following Christ;
so that the Christian traveller may be preserved from taking up a rest in his own works,
trusting in a form of godliness without its life and power.
May a sense of this danger deeply impress the minds of such religiously disposed persons
as have been addressed in the several preceding paragraphs of this chapter.
In order to place the subject before them in a clear point of view,
may they earnestly give attention to these next observations
founded principally on the following precept of our Redeemer--He whom,
let us ever remember, our heavenly Father has commanded us to hear (Matt 17:5).
"`__If any man will come after Me,__`"--in other words,
if any man will be a Christian indeed,--
"`__let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.__`" (Luke 9:23)

The effects which result from faithfully persevering in this course
(which, we must acknowledge, our Savior Himself has pointed out to us)
are briefly described by the apostle Paul in this way:
"`I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live,
but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh
I live by the faith of the Son of God,
who loved me and gave Himself for me.`" (Gal. 2:20)
This eminent minister of Christ not
only witnessed the mortification of the flesh in his own person,
but also enforced it on those among whom he labored in the following emphatic language:
"`This I say then, walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh;
for the flesh lusts,`" or strives "`against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh;
and these are contrary to one another.`" (Gal. 5:16-17)
And in order to convince us
that walking in the Spirit and bearing the daily cross
are absolutely necessary to our becoming true Christians, he declares,
"`Those who are Christ`'s have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts.`"
(Gal. 5:24)

This observation of the apostle
respecting the conflict which takes place between the Spirit and the flesh
may be considered applicable to all mankind,
however diversified as to religious profession.
Now whichever of these (the Spirit or the flesh) we join with and obey,
by this are we influenced and governed,--"`You are that one`'s servants whom you obey,
whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness.`" (Rom. 6:16)
The Spirit prompts us to deny self,
to crucify the flesh by taking up our cross daily, and to follow Christ;
its purifying effects in our hearts being demonstrated by our living
"`soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.`" (Tit. 2:11)
And if this divine instructor in its further manifestations in our hearts is obeyed
(through the ability which it imparts)
it will enable us "`to worship the Father in spirit and in truth.`"

But the tempter, through the medium of the flesh,
strives in various ways to obstruct and prevent these most desirable results.
When his efforts are ineffectual to draw awakened minds back
again into their former habits of gross irreligion and sin,
he then employs a more insidious snare by assuming a religious character
and making a superficial show of piety and devotion while still opposing the Holy Spirit.
This opposition to the Spirit is pursued by means of deceptive insinuations
calculated to prevent its life-giving admonitions from being listened to and obeyed.

In particular, the enemy strives to excite
and to foster in the minds of many professed Christians
an aversion to the duty of "`watching;`" (Eph. 6:18; Mark 13:37, Matt. 14:38, Col. 4:2)
which appears to include a patient waiting for the Lord
in the exercise of faith and love (see Hos. 12:6; Isa. 40:31; Ps. 40:1).
This duty is mercifully designed to be the means by which in stillness^
footnote:["`Be still, and know that I am God.`" (Ps. 46:10)]
(weak and feeble and liable to be misled as we all are of ourselves)
the sincere in heart may hear the voice of the "`good Shepherd`" and
may receive from Him instruction to perceive, and strength to avoid temptation,
as well as ability to offer up their prayers in His holy name to their heavenly Father.

But the enemy, through the carnal mind, suggests doubts as to
whether this duty of watching be really obligatory.
In order effectually to divert the professors of religion from the practice of it,
he prompts them to place their dependence on _their own wisdom_ and activity,
rather than to submit to so self-denying an exercise of mind.
In all cases in which these insinuations are embraced and followed,
the secret warnings of the spirit of Christ become gradually disregarded;
darkness then ensues; and the great work of purifying the heart is obstructed.
They seek, and soon find, a way to walk in
that is more agreeable to the natural will and the pride of the human heart,
than that in which the denial of self
and the patient bearing of the daily cross are required.
Their faith standing not in the power of God but in the wisdom of men
(1 Cor. 2:5) they are frequently running after this or the other eloquent minister,
not regarding the declaration of Christ--"`the kingdom of God is within you;`"
nor seeking the manifestation of this
kingdom and the righteousness of God according to His command (Matt. 6:33).
As they go on in this course they become (in very many instances)
strongly attached to forms and ceremonies
set up and commanded by human wisdom and authority;
and thus they are led into the practice of will-worship.

Alas! how greatly is the brightness of genuine Christianity obscured in the present day
among very many professors of it,
through their not duly watching against and avoiding
the influence and efforts of the carnal mind in every form
under which it opposes and strives against the Spirit of Christ.
They will probably admit that watchfulness is required
as a preservative from violating the precepts of morality
in their general conduct and conversation; but they appear not to be sufficiently aware
that it is especially necessary in regard to the
worship which they offer to Almighty God.
For in this solemn engagement,
as far as they are led by the activity of self or the flesh,
so far are their minds disqualified for the reception
of the life-giving influence of the Spirit of
Christ--through which alone the acceptable worship, which is in spirit and in truth,
can be offered.
So that however ardent their zeal may be in devotional exercises,
and however delightful the passions it excites, yet,
if the influence by which they act in their worship
is not that of the Spirit of Christ, the conclusion seems inevitable
that it proceeds from self or the carnal mind.

How needful then is it for professed Christians of every denomination
(under a conviction of the great danger a
mistake in this important concern would mean for them)
to lay open their hearts in all humility and sincerity
to the discriminating ray of the light of Christ, to that standard
to which the apostle directs our attention--"`All things that are reproved
are made manifest by the light,
for whatsoever does make manifest is light`" (Eph. 5:13)--that,
under its direction they may be enabled to form a true judgment
as to which influence has obtained the government in their minds.

The sad consequences of continuing to act under the
influence of that which opposes the Spirit of Christ
may be inferred from these words of the same apostle: "`To be carnally minded is death,
but to be spiritually minded is life and peace;
because the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God,
nor indeed can be;
so then they that are in the flesh`" (they in whom the carnal mind predominates)
"`cannot please God.`" (Rom. 8:6-8)
To which it may be added
that however highly they may characterize their religious attainments,
yet while they remain in this state,
they are incapable of participating in that fellowship
which is "`with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.`" (1 John 1:3)

In returning to the description which the apostle gives of his own experience
already quoted, let us take into view what he says in another place,
on the same important subject:

[quote.scripture, , Rom 6:3-6]
____
Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus
were baptized into His death?
Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death,
that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of life...
knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him,
that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.
____

[.no-indent]
By thus conforming to the doctrine of his Lord in bearing the daily cross,
and by submitting to the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
the apostle was enabled to say:
"`I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me.`"
(Gal 2:20)

May all professed Christians be stimulated and encouraged to
press forward to the attainment of this state^
footnote:[Let it not be supposed that the high privileges
which the Christian dispensation holds out to mankind
do not include the attainment of this state.
Our Lord Jesus Christ prayed to the Father
not only on behalf of His immediate followers,
but for those also who would believe in Him
through their word, "`That they all may be one,
as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they may be one in Us.
__I in them, and You in Me__,`" etc.--concluding His supplication
(which should be read with reverence and awe) in these words:
"`I have declared unto them __Your name__, and will declare it;
that the love with which You have loved Me, may be in them, and __I in them.__`"
(John 17:20,21,23,26)]
according to the measure of divine light or grace dispensed to them.
May they be so humbled by the power of God,
as to become willing to "`deny self,`" "`the flesh,`"
or "`the carnal mind;`" in other words,
to "`put off __the old man__ with his deeds;`" (Col. 3:9)
not only _his_ grossly corrupt and sinful practices,
but also _his_ acts of devotion--__his__ praying and singing,
and (in respect to ministry) _his_ preaching too.
Then will they be enabled, by following Christ in the regeneration (Matt. 19:28),
to "`put on the new man; which was created according to God in true righteousness and holiness.`"
(Eph. 4:24) They will become true worshippers--like the believers formerly--__worshipping
God in the Spirit, rejoicing in Christ Jesus,
and having no confidence in the flesh__. (Phil. 3:3)

The Scriptures declare that
"`as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God;`" (Rom. 8:14)
and that "`the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with.`" (1 Cor. 12:7)
How desirable, how indispensable then is it, that all--
and especially those who call themselves ministers of Christ--
should follow the putting forth and leadings of His Spirit in their own minds.
The teaching of the Spirit of Christ is always
in accordance with His doctrines and precepts
which are presented to us in the Scriptures.
Therefore those who are in office as ministers of Christ
(if they be truly such and be indeed led by His Spirit)
will manifest, not only in their conduct and conversation, but also _in their ministry,_
a faithful adherence to that portion of His doctrine already referred to
wherein He urges the necessity of denying self, taking up the daily cross, and following Him.

But if any who undertake the office of a Christian minister
show in their general behavior a disposition to evade the denial of self,
to shrink from bearing the cross
and from putting "`off the old man with his deeds;`" (Col. 3:9)--if,
instead of following the Spirit of Christ in their ministry
they follow the suggestions of their own "`fleshly wisdom,`" (2 Cor. 1:12)
"`teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,`" (Matt. 15:9)
our Lord`'s own declaration seems to authorize the conclusion
that their worship is "`in vain.`"
And when any of those who
decline the use of the modes and forms of worship prescribed by human authority
and profess to depend on the direction of the Spirit of Truth
do not wait in humility of mind for its life-giving influence, but in their self-will
and under the impulse of creaturely zeal
undertake to preach or to pray in their public assemblies, these performances,
like the offering of strange fire under the Mosaic dispensation, (Lev. 10:1)
may be considered to be in a particular manner offensive in the divine sight.

In all these cases, unless they submit to that divine word,
which is said to be "`like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces,`" (Jer. 23:29)
and unless by its effectual operation they are
brought to the experience of true humiliation and contrition,
and through repentance witness purification of heart from pride and exaltation of self,
they are in danger of becoming like unto some formerly
of whom we read that they
"`shut up the kingdom of heaven against men;`" neither going in themselves
nor permitting "`them that are entering to go in.`" (Matt. 23:13)
If they persist in this course,
disregarding the convictions of the Spirit of Christ, which,
from the time when they began to reject its admonitions in their own consciences,
it may be presumed has not failed at seasons still to reprove them,
they will become more and more "`laden with iniquity.`" (Isa. 1:4)
And by thus
continuing to transgress the law written on the table of the heart,
there will be much ground for them to fear--
however successful they may esteem their ministerial labors--
that ultimately their portion will be with those
concerning whom our Holy Redeemer has declared, "`Many will say to Me in that day, '`Lord, Lord,
have we not prophesied (or preached) in your name, cast out demons in Your name,
and done many wonders in Your name?`' And then will I declare to them,
'`I never knew you; depart from Me, you that work iniquity.`'`" (Matt. 7:22-23)
